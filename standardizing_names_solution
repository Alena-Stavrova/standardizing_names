Problem: 
Return the list of the names in a standardized way: the first letter of name or surname should be capital, the rest letters should be lowercase.
Return the standardized names and surnames as two additional columns, new_first_name and new_last_name.

Solution (MySQL):
SELECT CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(first_name, 1)), LOWER(SUBSTRING(first_name, 2, LENGTH(first_name)))) as new_first_name, CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(last_name, 1)), LOWER(SUBSTRING(last_name, 2, LENGTH(last_name)))) as new_last_name FROM students;
